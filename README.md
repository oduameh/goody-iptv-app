# Goody IPTV web (PWA starter)

This is a one-folder deploy. Host it anywhere static (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, S3).
- `index.html` loads the Ireland playlist by default.
- `manifest.json` + `sw.js` make it installable as a PWA.
- Icons: 192 and 512 PNGs.

## Local preview
Just open `index.html` or serve it:
`python3 -m http.server 8080` then visit http://localhost:8080
